### Features

* `Grease Pencil Object`: Link the FBX of your Grease Pencil Object.
* `Create Animation`: Recreate the animation, it will create a .anim
  on the same folder as the FBX with activation keys.
* `Create Corresponding Materials`: Choose the shader used to create
  the material (A custom shader is available on Gumroad)
* `Create Materials`: Create the Grease Pencil material (support of
  main color and stroke texture) with the shader linked. It will
  create materials on the same folder as the FBX.

To use the script, first link the FBX, then create the animation (and
material if necessary). The .anim and .mat created need to be linked
manually for the object inside the FBX.
